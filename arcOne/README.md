The open-source Arc One WAAM platform is built on a modular aluminum T-slot extrusions. The cartesian gantry runs on MGN15 linear rails and sliders with NEMA 23 steppers and T8×8 lead screws within its 425 × 625 × 225 mm build area. Weld deposition occurs on a separate heavy cast-iron machine table (450 × 760 mm, ~300 lb) to isolate heat and distortion from the lightweight frame. A standalone aluminum-extrusion enclosure with flame-retardant welding screens and fume extraction surrounds the frame to provide safety and partial environmental control. While core structural parts are metal for durability at elevated temperatures, non-critical mounts and fixtures are 3D-printed in polycarbonate for functionality and heat resistance.
